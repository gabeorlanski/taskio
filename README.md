# TaskIO (TIO)

A minimal framework for handling tasks input and output processing. This is heavily inspired by [Google's SeqIO](https://github.com/google/seqio) but not written with `tf.data`. For the time being, this uses [HuggingFace's Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) framework as the backbone.


### Install
